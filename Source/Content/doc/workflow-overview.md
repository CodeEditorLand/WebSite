# Land Project Architecture

A high-level overview of the architecture and the core workflows that drive the
application. Our system is composed of three primary components:

- **`Common` 🧑🏻‍🏭 (Rust Crate):** The abstract core library. It defines the
  architectural "language" of the application through traits, data structures
  (DTOs), and a declarative Effect system. It has no knowledge of the final
  implementation.
- **`Mountain` ⛰️ (Rust Application):** The native backend. It is a Tauri
  application that implements the abstract traits from `Common`, manages the
  native OS interactions, runs a gRPC server, and orchestrates the `Cocoon`
  sidecar process.
- **`Wind` 🍃 & `Sky` 🌌 (TypeScript UI):** The frontend. `Wind` is a
  re-implementation of the VS Code workbench services using `Effect-TS`,
  providing the application logic for the UI. `Sky` is the `Astro`-based UI
  layer that renders the editor interface and bridges `Tauri` events to the
  workbench via `SkyBridge`.
- **`Cocoon` 🦋 (TypeScript Application):** A Node.js sidecar process managed by
  `Mountain`. It is responsible for running extensions in a sandboxed
  environment and providing them with a high-fidelity `vscode` API.

Communication between `Mountain` and `Cocoon` is handled via **gRPC**, while
communication between `Mountain` and `Wind/Sky` is handled via **Tauri Events
and Commands**.

## Table of Contents 📑

### Core Workflows 🔄

1.  [**Application Startup & Handshake**](/Doc/workflow-startup)
    - _Describes the complete end-to-end process of launching `Mountain`,
      spawning `Cocoon`, and establishing a stable, initialized state for both
      the UI and the extension host._

2.  [**Opening a File from the UI**](/Doc/workflow-open-file)
    - _Details the flow from a user clicking a file in the explorer to the
      content being read from disk by `Mountain` and rendered in an editor by
      `Wind`._

3.  [**Invoking a Language Feature (Hover Provider)**](/Doc/workflow-hover-provider)
    - _A key example of bi-directional communication, showing how an extension
      in `Cocoon` registers a feature, `Mountain` orchestrates the request, and
      the result is displayed in the `Wind` UI._

4.  [**Saving a File with Save Participants**](/Doc/workflow-save-participants)
    - _Explains the advanced process of intercepting a save event, allowing an
      extension in `Cocoon` to modify a file (e.g., for formatting) before
      `Mountain` writes it to disk._

5.  [**Executing a Command from the Command Palette**](/Doc/workflow-command-palette)
    - _Illustrates the unified command system, showing how `Mountain`'s command
      registry can seamlessly dispatch execution to either a native Rust handler
      or a proxied command in `Cocoon`._

6.  [**Creating and Interacting with a Webview Panel**](/Doc/workflow-webview)
    - _Details the full lifecycle of extension-contributed UI, from `Cocoon`
      requesting a panel to `Mountain` managing the native webview window and
      proxying messages back and forth._

7.  [**Creating and Interacting with an Integrated Terminal**](/Doc/workflow-terminal)
    - _A deep dive into native process management, showing how `Mountain` spawns
      a PTY process and streams its I/O to both the `Wind` frontend and the
      `Cocoon` extension host._

8.  [**Source Control Management (SCM)**](/Doc/workflow-scm)
    - _Outlines how the built-in Git extension in `Cocoon` uses `Mountain` as a
      service to run native `git` commands and then populates the SCM view in
      the UI with the results._

9.  [**User Data Synchronization**](/Doc/workflow-user-data-sync)
    - _Describes the end-to-end process of syncing user settings. It covers user
      authentication, fetching data from a remote store, performing a three-way
      merge, applying changes locally, and notifying all parts of the
      application._

10. [**Running Extension Tests**](/Doc/workflow-extension-tests)
    - _Explains the "Extension Development Host" model, where a second, isolated
      instance of the application is launched to run tests, with the test
      `Cocoon` instance remote-controlling the main UI._

11. [**Tier-Gated Implementation Selection**](/Doc/workflow-tier-gated-implementation-selection)
    - _Describes how the `.env.Land` file propagates through Maintain's build
      script into `Mountain`'s `build.rs`, Cocoon's esbuild define map, and
      Sky's Vite define map - allowing each capability with more than one viable
      implementation (gRPC vs native, JS glob vs `globset`, etc.) to live in the
      codebase simultaneously and be selected at build time without duplicating
      call sites._

### Work in Progress (Documentation) 🚧

The following workflows are implemented in the codebase but are pending detailed
documentation.

- **Tree View Data Flow**
    - _Describes how the UI requests children for a tree view node, and how
      `Mountain` proxies this request to the correct `TreeDataProvider` in
      `Cocoon`._
- **Custom Editor Lifecycle**
    - _Details the process of opening a file in a custom editor, handling edits,
      saving custom document data, and managing backups and reverts._
- **Debugging Session Lifecycle**
    - _Outlines the flow from launching a debug configuration to `Mountain`
      starting a debug adapter, and how debug events (breakpoints, step, pause)
      are communicated between the UI, `Mountain`, and `Cocoon`._
- **Task Execution**
    - _Explains how tasks defined in `tasks.json` or by extensions are
      discovered and executed, including how their output is piped to a terminal
      view._
